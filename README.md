👋 Hey there!

This repo contains all the CLI and GUI projects I’m working on (mostly experiments and learning tools).  
Even if there’s just 500 lines of code overall, I’m proud of it—because I built it, and others might find it helpful!

Feel free to fork, remix, reuse, or tinker with anything here.

> *Note: I’m just learning. Take the code as-is, and enjoy.*
