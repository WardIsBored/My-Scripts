# Myâ€‘Scripts

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

This repo contains all the CLI and GUI projects Iâ€™m working on (mostly experiments and learning tools).  
Even if thereâ€™s just 500 lines of code overall, Iâ€™m proud of itâ€”because I built it, and others might find it helpful!

Feel free to fork, remix, reuse, or tinker with anything here.

> *Note: Iâ€™m just learning. Take the code as-is, and enjoy.*
